    "<h3> Proofreading Status Descriptions</h3>\n",
    "prf_metadata['description']=\"The proofreading status of neurons that have been comprehensively proofread within this version. Axon and dendrite compartment status are marked separately under 'axon_status' and 'dendrite_status', as proofreading effort was applied differently to the different compartments in some cells. There are three possible status values for each compartment: 'non' indicates no comprehensive proofreading. 'clean' indicates that all false merges have been removed, but all tips have not necessarily been followed. 'extended' indicates that the cell is both clean and all tips have been followed as far as a proofreader was able to. The 'pt_position' is at a cell body or similar core position for the cell. The column 'valid_id' provides the root id when the proofreading was last checked. If the current root id in 'pt_root_id' is not the same as 'valid_id', there is no guarantee that the proofreading status is correct. Very small false axon merges (axon fragments approximately 5 microns or less in length) were considered acceptable for clean neurites. Note that this table does not list all edited cells, but only those with comprehensive effort toward the status mentioned here. Table compiled by Sven Dorkenwald and Casey Schneider-Mizell, including work by many proofreaders and data maintained by Stelios Papadopoulos.\"\n",

These skeletons are stored in an h5 file format, and also contain annotations on the skeletons that have the synapses, which skeleton nodes are axon and which are dendrite, and which are likely the apical dendrite of excitatory neurons. \n",
