    "Various studies have found that cortical excitatory neurons exhibit targeting preferences that change with distance along the axon. For example, in medial entorhinal cortex, [Schmidt et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28959971/) found that, closer to the soma, there was a bias toward targeting inhibitory neurons. We're going to look at this question from our EM dataset. This question will extend the E/I target analysis from Task 2 and add in spatial information about the synapse locations."
