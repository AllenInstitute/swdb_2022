If you want to run these libraries independently of each other, then it is easily done by creating separate conda environments: one that runs against python 3.7, and one that runs against python 3.8. Overall, conda allows you to:\n",

There are more relaxed community channels that host packages, such as conda-forge. For the purposes of this course, we will be using the default channel.\n",
    "<li> Pip requires a python interpreter to already be installed. Conda can install a python interpreter itself, which is how it is able to set up a python environment.\n",

    "<p> When you create a conda environment:\n",

    "<li> If you have multiple projects, you may want to have different packages available to each project. Conda helps you set up an \"environment\" for each project so that their packages stay separate from each other. (Maybe you have very old code that hasn't been upgraded to run in python3. You can run that code in its own conda environment, and still run pandas in python3 in a separate environment.)\n",
