First we tell git which changes will be included in the next commit, and then we commit all staged changes at once. In this simple example, it may seem like an unnecessary extra step. If git already knows which files have changed, why not just commit all changes automatically?\n",

    "<p>When working with any version control system, it is helpful for each code snapshot to introduce changes that are <i>complete</i> and <i>related</i>. Ideally, each new commit should add one new feature, or bugfix, or concept, and the commit should not contain unfinished ideas. Why is this good practice? Sometimes we need to go back through the history of changes to find where a bug was introduced, or to revert a set of changes, or even just to understand the structure of the commit history (which can become quite complex).\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>But many of us don't program that way--we like to plow through the code, making many unrelated changes here and there. In practice, it is very easy (and common) to lose track of which files you have changed in between commits. Perhaps you added some temporary debugging code that you forgot to remove, or started a new file but forgot to ask git to track it, or forgot about an unfinished piece of code. \n",
